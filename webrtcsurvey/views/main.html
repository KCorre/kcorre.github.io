  <p>Security on the Web is usually perceived by users through a green lock next to the URL adress bar of their browser.
    This icon informs users that the Website they are visiting is accessed through a secure connection.
    In addition, it also indicates that the web server has been authenticated through a cryptographic certificate.
    Thus the browser asserts that <b>no attacker can break the confidentiality of the exchange</b> and that <b>no attacker is impersonating the website</b>.

  <p>With the advent of technology such as WebRTC, real-time communications are moving to the Internet.
    The security of such communication is more complex than for a single web page as it now involves more actors.
    <b>We propose a represenation of the trust that the end-user (you!) should have in a given online communication setup.</b>
  </p>

  <p>This survey will be used to evaluate the interest, usefulness, and clarity of our model as a security knowledge
    representation. </p>

  <p>The first half of the survey is dedicated to your actual trust in real time communication services.
    The second half of the survey let you play with our model, before some questions on your perception of the way our model
    represents information.
  </p>

  <p>The survey should not take more than 10 minutes to complete.</p>

  <p>A certificate chain is an ordered hierarchy of digital certificates. In the chain, each certificates is signed by
    a higher level certificate. The top-level certificate is provided by a root certificate authority. This mechanism
    of trust propagation, allows an individuals to verify the validity of a certificate without direct trust in the
    certificate's issuer.</p>

  <p>In practice, root certificates are pre-loaded by browser vendors. When verifying a certificate provided by a web-server,
  a web-browser must verify the validity of the whole certificate chain.</p>

  <p>The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family is often used to sign certificates. SHA-1 is now deemed unsecure and is
  gradually withdrawn from use by Certificate Authority as well as browser vendors.</p>


  <p>The above figure represents a certificate chain containing a weak certificate using SHA-1. Arrows represent trust
  relations, i.e. the Browser trusts the Root CA, which in turn trusts the CA. This last CA trust the Web Site owner
  (as to be the owner of the domain). This allows, in theory, the browser to establish a transitive trust relationship
  to the actual web server.</p>

  <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocols used to ensure communications security over various
  applications.</p>

  <p>Communications security includes properties of privacy, authentication and integrity.
    In TLS privacy is provided by symmetric cryptography (e.g. with AES), authentication by public
    key cryptography (e.g. with RSA), and data integrity with Message Authentication Code (for instance with HMAC-SHA-1).</p>

  <p>In this section, we are interested in the trust you may have in different communication services or communication scenarios. </p>

  <p>Real Time Communication services allow for usages such as voice call, video call, and file sharing.
    The communication is generally established by the exchange of signalling messages between participants.
    These signalling messages are relayed by one or more Communication Services (CS).
    CS are also responsible for authenticating their own participants when they connect to the service.</p>


  <img src="../images/webrtc.021c416b.png" width="25%" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

  <p>WebRTC is a standard API provided by Web browsers for RTC communications.
    As it is provided by web-browser any websites could become its own CS and offer RTC functionnalities.
    WebRTC also offers a way for call-participants to exchange <b>identity assertion</b> provided by a third-party
    <b>Identity Provider (IdP)</b>.
    This IdP is independant from the communication services and allows users to authenticate directly to other participants.
    The identity assertion is verified by the browser which then asserts that Bob is the participant on the other end of the call.

  <p>We propose a method for modeling and computing the trust that an end-user (or a policy authority) could have in a given online communication setup.
    To this end, we build a user-centric functional decomposition of security properties and protocols from a communication setup.
    We use information-theory entropy as a base trust metric and compute a global trust value with aggregation operators.
    This end-value is then returned to the user. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><b>Functional Decomposition Model<br></b> We observe that security algorithms or protocols serve one or more objectives,
      and expect that some properties be fulfilled by other protocols. For instance a protocol may be used to provide a
      confidential exchange between Alice and Bob but would require Bob to be authenticated beforehand in order to be secure.
      These security algorithms also rely on random values such as cryptographic keys, hash digest, etc.</p>

    <p>We decompose a security configuration into several <b>components</b>. Each components <b>fulfill requirements and require
    requirements</b> provided by other components. One of the requirement is the root of our decomposition tree, i.e. the
    security property expected from the configuration. Some of these requirements are leaf of the decomposition tree,
    we call them <b>primitives</b>. They represent security objects such as cryptographic keys or hash digest.
    As such they can be <b>assigned entropy value</b> representing their resistance against attack.</p>

    <p><b>Computational Model</b><br>
      In order to compute the security level of a requirement realized by a component, we define aggregation operators
      at the component level. Working from bottom to top, we use these operators to compute the value of the root. These
      aggregation operators, set on a component, take requirements and primitives security value as input and return a
      single security value which is associated to the component parent requirement.</p>

    <p>Based on our observations and models from the literature we use two operators: <b>Weakest Link (MIN)</b> and
      <b>Additive (SUM)</b> operators.</p>

    <p>It is possible to estimate at which computational cost a component is deemed secure. Based on this estimation a

      recommendation provided by third-party (e.g. ANSSI RGS). We define our <b>security scale as a range on [0; 1]</b> with 0 meaning no
      security and 1 meaning adequate protection [Lenstra, 2004].
      Entropy values are then normalized with respect to the recommended minimum entropy. Value greater than their recommendation are normalized to 1.

    <p>We also want to fit the trust model to the user point-of-view, its own subjectivity. To this end we add, on top of our model, an optional trust layer

  </div>
    <p><b>Subjective weighting<br></b> Our standard model considers the difficulty for an attacker to mount an attack on
      one of the properties expected by the user. Trust can be interpreted as a ”subjective probability with which an
      agent will perform a particular action”. We consider actors not behaving as expected as attackers themselves.
      Indeed they could be cooperating with an attacker, actively or unintentionally. Their position in the chain of
      operations may give them important advantages on mounting these attacks. We thus compute the security expected
      value (in the sense of probability theory). Practically,
      this means that the security expected value is the trust-weighted average of its objective security value (genuine
      actor) and zero (actor as an attacker).</p>

    Here we model the security and trust of a WebRTC session.
    The idea is to represent the trust that a user may have in the confidentiality of his communication.
    We consider a call-session involving two participants, <b>Alice (you) and Bob.</b>
    Each participants use a different communication service, <b>CSA</b> and <b>CSB</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
      Bob also provides an identity assertion signed by and verified through <b>IdPB</b>, his Identity Provider.
      This identity assertion binds the fingerprint of the session, <b>FnP</b>, to Bob's identity ensuring that no one is able to impersonate Bob.
