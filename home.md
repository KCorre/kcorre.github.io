# Presentation

PhD R&D Software Engineer, I am specialising on Web and Communication Protocols Security.
Currently I am working at Nagra/Kudelski Security, for the Software Security Team in Rennes. But I can't say more :)

During my PhD, I focused on the integration of authentication delegation protocols, such as OAuth2, into the WebRTC security architecture.
If you are interested in the results of this research work, you can check on **[my thesis on github](https://github.com/Sparika/PHD)**.
I enjoyed this topic as it was involving recent W3C and IETF standards, security protocols, and JavaScript prototyping. 
This work was accomplished at **Orange Labs** in the Identity and Trust Architecture research team and at **INRIA/IRISA** in the most awesome **[Diverse Team](http://diverse.irisa.fr/)**.
I also had the opportunity to contribute to the H2020 reThink project.

My Thesis supervisors were **[Olivier Barais](http://olivier.barais.fr/)**
and **[Gerson Sunye](http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/members/gerson.sunye/index_html?set_language=en)**.

Previously, from 2012 to 2014, I worked as an engineer at INRIA Rennes to develop PLASMA Lab, a statistical model checker.
I graduated from Master Degree in Computer Science from the University of Orleans in 2012.

#### Topics of Interest
During my thesis, my research topics were related to **Identity Management** in the **Web** context and more particularly with the use case of **WebRTC** in mind.
I worked on figuring out how existing Web identity protocols such as **Oauth2** and **OIDC** could be used through a Web API.

At the same time, the W3C is continuing to add new functionalities and responsibilities to Web browsers.
Several new Web APIs require the browser to manage user authorization grants to Web origin.
One of such API is developed by the **[Web Payment Working Group](https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/)**.
While the WebRTC Identity Architecture did not get much traction in the end, the work of the Web Payment Working Group is being implemented in all major browser.
However, the proposed Web Payment architecture follows similar design as the one proposed in WebRTC Identity Architecture, i.e. request for token from third party trusted provider through a Web API.

There are many interesting questions behind such architecture, and solving them could allow to offer a decentralised authentication on the Web!


More broadly, I'm also interested in gaining experience in Web Assembly, JavaScript, Rust, and C development.

#### Tools

The best way to see what I'm working on is to head over [Github](https://github.com/Sparika).

* [WebConnect](https://github.com/Sparika/WebConnect/) a Firefox Web Extension for browser based identity management, based on WebRTC and **JWT**.
* [ACOR_SDP](https://github.com/Sparika/ACOR_SDP/) a WebRTC service that allows identity parameter negotiation through SDP messages.

I contributed to the **[reThink european project](https://rethink-project.eu/)**.

Previously I worked on [PLASMA Lab](https://project.inria.fr/plasma-lab/), a statistical model-checking tool. Besides implementing PLASMA Lab's GUI and the algorithms produced by the team, I developed distributed versions of these algorithms and an interface with Simulink.
