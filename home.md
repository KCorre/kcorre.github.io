# Presentation
I am a PhD. student  at the University of Rennes 1.
Since October 2014, I am working at **Orange Labs** in the Identity and Trust Architecture research team and at **INRIA/IRISA** in the **[Diverse Team](http://diverse.irisa.fr/)**.
My Thesis supervisors are **[Olivier Barais](http://olivier.barais.fr/)**
and **[Gerson Sunye](http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/members/gerson.sunye/index_html?set_language=en)**.

Previously, from 2012 to 2014, I worked as an engineer at INRIA Rennes to develop PLASMA Lab, a statistical model checker.

I graduated from Master Degree in Computer Science from the University of Orleans in 2012.

I will defend my PhD Thesis around October 2017. If you are looking for a Computer Scientist, I'm looking for a job!

#### Research
Currently my topics of interest are related to **Identity Management** in the **Web** context and more particularly with the use case of **WebRTC** in mind.

I am building a **Trust Models** for **Real-Time Communications Services**, i.e. WebRTC.
The novelty of WebRTC is that the authentication of the call party is decoupled from the signaling process.
Identity Providers (IdP) are introduced in the loop.
The explicit authentication of the other peer is an interesting paradigm to solve issue we have in the
legacy telco services.
But it also has drawbacks in terms of choice of IdPs and privacy.
Ultimately, is it possible to use an **untrusted** communication services if we trust the IdPs?

Meanwhile, the W3C is working on adding new functionalities and responsibilities to Web browsers.
Several new Web APIs require the browser to manage user authorization grant to Web origin.
Identity management could be one of these new functions.
Figuring out how existing Web identity protocols such as **Oauth2** and **OIDC** could be used through a Web API
is another interesting topics which poses new questions.

#### Tools

The best way to see what I'm working on is to head over [Github](https://github.com/Sparika).

* [WebConnect](https://github.com/Sparika/WebConnect/) a Firefox Web Extension for browser based identity management, based on WebRTC and **JWT**.
* [ACOR_SDP](https://github.com/Sparika/ACOR_SDP/) a WebRTC service that allows identity parameter negotiation through SDP messages.

I contributed to the **[reThink european project](https://rethink-project.eu/)**.

Previously I worked on [PLASMA Lab](https://project.inria.fr/plasma-lab/), a statistical model-checking tool. Besides implementing PLASMA Lab's GUI and the algorithms produced by the team, I developed distributed versions of these algorithms and an interface with Simulink.
